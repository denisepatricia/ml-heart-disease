# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning


Heart disease (HD) is a collection of diseases and conditions that cause cardiovascular problems. (Whithworth,2020) It is one of the most common diseases today, and early detection is critical for many health care providers in order to protect their patients from developing the disease and save lives. Every year, according to the World Health Organization, 12 million people die from heart diseases around the world. Cardiovascular diseases account for half of all deaths in the United States and other developed countries. The ability to predict the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases early can help high-risk patients make lifestyle changes and, as a result, reduce complications. The goal of this study is to identify the most important/risk factors for heart disease and to use logistic regression to predict the overall risk.
